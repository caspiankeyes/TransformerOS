# GPT Failure Trees Symbolic Shell Pack
# 
# This shell pack contains diagnostic shells specifically tailored for
# the GPT model family, designed to probe pathways that OpenAI's logging
# systems typically don't capture or analyze in depth.
#
# These shells map GPT's cognitive architecture through controlled
# diagnostic failures, revealing structures that are typically invisible
# to standard prompt engineering and monitoring.
